        This document specifies an API that allows web applications to increase
        the brightness of a device's screen under certain conditions.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Allowing web applications to request an increase to the display's
        brightness would help address the following use cases:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          a user scans a QR/barcode under various lighting conditions, in which
          case boosting the screen brightness creates more contrast.
        </li>
        <li>
          illuminate a user's facial features, improving the viability of
          certain web applications that rely on the front facing camera (e.g.,
          make up mirror style apps, and applications that can scan people's
          facial features to perform some particular action).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The proposed Screen Brightness API extends the
        <code><dfn data-cite="CSSOM-View#screen">Screen</dfn></code> interface
        with a new operation, inspired by the [[screen-wake-lock]] API.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Policy control</h3>
      <p>
        The Screen Brightness API defines a [=policy-controlled feature=]
        identified by the string `"screen-brightness"`. Its [=default
        allowlist=] is `["self"]`.
      </p>
      <aside class="note">
        <p>
          The <a>default allowlist</a> of `["self"]` allows screen brightness
          increase usage in same-origin nested frames but prevents third-party
          content from increasing screen brightness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third-party usage can be selectively enabled by adding
          `allow="screen-brightness"` attribute to the frame container element:
        </p>
        <pre
          class="example html"
          title="Enabling screen brightness on remote content"
        >
          &lt;iframe src="https://third-party.com" allow="screen-brightness"/&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
        </pre>
        <p>
          Alternatively, the Screen Brightness API can be disabled completely by
          specifying the permissions policy in a HTTP response header:
        </p>
        <pre class="example http" title="Feature Policy over HTTP">
          Permissions-Policy: {"screen-brightness": []}
        </pre>
        <p>See [[[PERMISSIONS-POLICY]]] for more details.</p>

      <h2>Security and privacy considerations</h2>
      <p>
        Active screen brightness increase requests will cause the display to
        operate at higher power levels than they otherwise would. This will lead
        to faster battery depletion. It is of particular concern for mobile
        devices, which often don't have a stationary power source readily
        available. Complete battery depletion at an unexpected time can lead to
        inability of the user to make or receive calls and use network services,
        including the emergency call service.
      </p>
      <p>
        Implementations MAY ignore requests for screen brightness increase if,
        for example, the battery capacity is low, or the user has put their
        device in a power-saving mode.
